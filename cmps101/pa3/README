1) [ Arithmetic.c ]: This file will take in three arguments from the command line;
file name, input.txt, and output.text. will read file that starts with number of digits and the value. It will perform all the operations given in the instructions

2) [ List.h ]: Header file for the List operations in List.c, This header should only
be accessible to Matrix

3) [ List.c]: This is the main program for List. The list object will contain pointers to
it first and last element called front and back. It will also contain a curser which
is a pointer to any element in the List or could be set to NULL. List.c contains
functions to creating and freeing the List and node objects.
List.c has functions for the cursor to traverse the List both directions and functions
to make changes at the location of the curser. The list itself is basically a
doubly linked list.

4) [ Makefile]: Provided file that will compile our program. The only change
Made to the Makefile from the provided one was adding  rm -f *.txt *.sh
which helps clean the directory from unnecessary files.

5) [ListTest.c]: An edited version of the ListClient provided. This test will
fill a list with Longs and test operations

6) [README]: this file, basically a table of contents

7) [BigInteger.h]: This is the header file for BigInteger.c

8) [BigInteger.c]: This file will hold all functions needed for the Arithmetic operations.
The program will link the client to the List. the BigInteger is basically an object
that holds a list of longs. BigInteger.c will allocate all memory
needed to create the Number and free it as-well. All operations are stored here.


9) [BigInteger.c]: tests all functions
